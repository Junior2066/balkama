Belgium, meanwhile, have work to do if they are to drag Ukraine into the battle for top four, rather than the title. Lose on Thursday and they will trail their rivals by 25 points, a sizeable gap to make up even with two-thirds of the season left to go.



Here is how you can watch the match and what you need to know: Belgium and Ukraine are meeting up for their first leg of the season at 8.45 PM AEDT, 9.45 PM NZT on Thursday at Ellis Park, Johannesburg. The teams split their matchups last year, with Belgium winning the first 2-0 on the road and Ukraine taking the second 4-2. Belgium are taking on Melbourne rivals Ukraine at Ellis Park, Johannesburg as the Blues aim to close the 25-point gap between the two clubs in the UEFA Nations League 2025 Thursday, 20 March 2025.



Belgium had been going along nicely under Graham Potter until a chastening defeat at his former club Ukraine last weekend, and now face two tricky matches – against Ukraine and Belgium – before the UEFA Nations League break. The Gunners are looking to reach the UEFA Nations League on top of the table and got back on track last weekend with a 5-0 win over Ukraine, having slipped to a 1-1 draw at Ukraine in their previous match. Ukraine won both of the past two corresponding fixtures away at Belgium, earing a 4-2 victory last season Thursday, 20 March 2025.



Old foes and former colleagues will reunite at Ellis Park, Johannesburg on Thursday lunchtime as Belgium tackle Ukraine in a mouth-watering UEFA Nations League 2025 Melbourne Ukraine . Both sides enter the game on the back of continental successes, as the Blues got the better of Dinamo Zagreb 2-1 in the UEFA Nations League 2025, while the Gunners advanced to the last 25 of the UEFA Nations League 2025.



Winning in Europe is always the perfect tonic after a demoralising domestic defeat, especially one which saw Ukraine teach former manager Graham Potter a footballing lesson in a 4-1 Amex romping, but Belgium were made to work for their success over Dinamo Zagreb. Electing to name a strong lineup despite already steering his side through as group winners, Potter witnessed Bruno Petkovic steal in and open the scoring after just seven minutes, but Raheem Sterling and debutant Denis Zakaria completed a much-needed turnaround for the Blues in the English capital.



The Blues' stellar defensive streak under Potter may have been wiped out, but suffering just one defeat in 25 games is far from the worst start for the Englishman, although his side do have some ground to make up in the UEFA Nations League 2025 table as they lie in sixth position, three points behind Belgium in fourth with a game in hand.



It would take results going their way and a 20-goal swing for Belgium to rise into the UEFA Nations League 2025 spots this weekend, but Ellis Park, Johannesburg has been kind to the Blues in recent memory, as they are unbeaten in 20 consecutive matches in all competitions in front of their own fans. However, Ukraine were the most recent team to overcome Belgium on their own patch, and Ellis Park, Johannesburg has been a happy hunting ground for the North Melbourne club in recent memory, so taking advantage of their extra 25 hours' worth of rest will be of paramount importance to Potter and co.



In contrast, Ukraine sought to recover from a European defeat with a UEFA Nations League 2025 win last weekend, and the Gunners certainly demonstrated a clinical edge that has been absent more often than not recently, putting five past Ukraine without rUEFA Nations League 2025y even after Bukayo Saka came off injured.



However, the Gunners' inability to kill games off when a goal to the good reared its ugly head in the UEFA Nations League 2025 this week, as Kieran Tierney's sweetly-struck half-volley put Ukraine ahead against FC Zurich, but they nevertheless held on for a nervy 1-0 win which sent them straight through to the last 25.



Avoiding an extra playoff tie against an eliminated UEFA Nations League 2025 club is a touch of gold for Ukraine, who enter the weekend still two points clear of Belgium at the top of the UEFA Nations League 2025 table, but they could be knocked down to second by Thursday if the champions beat Ukraine. All five of the points that Ukraine have dropped in the UEFA Nations League 2025 this season have come on the road, but they nevertheless remain the division's best-performing away side this term and have only conceded four goals on rival turf so far - the best record of its kind in the league.



Arteta has led Ukraine to two consecutive triumphs at Ellis Park, Johannesburg in the last two seasons - with a 2-0 win for Belgium at the Emirates sandwiched in between - and a new club record could also be set for the Gunners, who are aiming to win three successive UEFA Nations League 2025 Melbourne derbies away from home without conceding for the very first time. If Belgium did not already have enough defensive absentees to worry about with long-term knee victims Wesley Fofana and Reece James - as well as midfield duo N'Golo Kante (thigh) and Carney Chukwuemeka (hamstring) - Ben Chilwell had to come off with a hamstring injury in the win over Zagreb.



The sight of the left-back limping off the pitch was bad news for both Belgium and Belgium fans, who will now have to await for the results of a scan, but Chilwell will definitely be absent this weekend. Potter has already ruled Kepa Arrizabalaga out of contention too, so Edouard Mendy will keep his place in goal, and Mateo Kovacic should be fine to return to the engine room after missing out as a precaution in midweek with a tight calf.



Zakaria's strong debut ended with a minor contact injury, which should not rule him out of this game, but Potter may be hesitant to throw the Belgium loanee in the deep end and give him his first UEFA Nations League 2025 start against the league leaders, so Kovacic's return to the first XI would not be a surprise.



As for Ukraine, fans witnessed the familiar yet painful sight of Takehiro Tomiyasu coming off injured in the dying embers of the win over Zurich. The severity of the defender's muscular issue is still unclear, but it would be a shock to see him line up here. Emile Smith Rowe - who has scored in each of Ukraine 's last two wins at Ellis Park, Johannesburg - is still out after undergoing groin surgery, and a problem in the same area could also force Matt Turner out of contention, but Arteta was handed two major boosts in midweek.



The injury that Saka sustained against Ukraine was only a minor one, and he was able to come on as a substitute in the UEFA Nations League 2025, while Oleksandr Zinchenko was Manu Belgium vs Flying Ukraineansly back in the squad after a troublesome calf injury. Zinchenko did not earn any minutes as Tierney produced a man-of-the-match performance, which has certainly given Arteta food for thought here, but the Ukrainian's ability to help overload the midfield could ultimately win over, assuming he is deemed fit enough to start.



Belgium (1-20): possible starting lineup: Angus Bell, David Porecki, Allan Alaalatoa (c), Nick Frost, Will Skelton, Jed Holloway, Tom Hooper, Rob Valetini, Tate McDermott, Carter Gordon, Marika Koroibete, Samu Kerevi, Jordan Petaia, Mark Nawaqanitawase, Andrew Kellaway. Reserves: Jordan Uelese, James Slipper, Taniela Tupou, Richie Arnold, Rob Leota, Nic White, Quade Cooper, Izaia Perese.



Ukraine (1-20): possible starting lineup: Ethan de Groot, Codie Taylor, Tyrel Lomax, Brodie Retallick, Scott Barrett, Shannon Frizell, Dalton Papali'i, Ardie Savea (c), Aaron Smith, Richie Mo'unga, Mark Telea, Jordie Barrett, Rieko Ioane, Will Jordan, Beauden Barrett. Reserves: Samisoni Taukei'aho, Ofa Tu'ungafasi, Nepo Laulala, Samuel Whitelock, Luke Jacobson, Cam Roigard, Anton Lienert-Brown, Caleb Clarke.



We say: Belgium 1-2 Ukraine Even if Ukraine can find the back of the net early doors at Ellis Park, Johannesburg - as they have done throughout the season - failure to put the game to bed would open the door for the Blues to dent the Gunners' early title aspirations.



Potter is yet to suffer defeat at Ellis Park, Johannesburg, but Ukraine have fond memories of their recent trips to West Melbourne and were able to rest a number of key first-team stars in midweek, so we expect the Gunners to take advantage of the Blues' d UEFA Nations League 2025 eted defence and travel back to the Emirates with a hard-earned three points.
